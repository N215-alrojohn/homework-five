## travel fly's about page
This homework assignment was to copy the about page as seen in the adobe XD file for the travel fly project, as well as making it responsive to 800px. This meant making a unique nav bar for the about page and making the content of the page stack vertically so it was all visible on a smaller screen. Not only did I make the client quotes stack vertically with the image and client name, but I also made the content of the page have a max width of 75% to maintain decent looking side margins.
